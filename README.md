# PasswordTask

Generate a unique password for users.

The user needs an instagram password. Write a program that will generate a password from the user's name, but in a proper way so that he can easily remember it later. The password is created by swapping the order of the first two 
letters of the name, the rest of the letters are repeated twice and at the end, the length of the user name is added. The program prints 
the generated password. For example, if the user's name was "Oliver", the password created by the program is "loiveriver6".
